## Project Requirements
We were given the task of creating and testing a program that will allow a user to sort a randomised array.

The user is able to pick from a variety of sorting algorithms to perform sorting with.

***The sorting methods we have included to date are:***

* BubbleSort
* MergeSort
* .NET library sort methods.

---
## Usage
1. The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from (Console)
2. Decision is given via the command line (Console.ReadLine())
3. The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line
4. The program should then output:
    1. The unsorted randomly generated array
    2. The sort algorithm to be used
    3. The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed 
    4. The time taken
